# Numeral-Decomposer-1.1
Improved version of Numeral Decompose 1.0, see https://github.com/ikmMaierBTUCS/Numeral-decomposer-1.0

'Code' is a Python script containing the function advanced_parse, which represents the Numeral Decomposer 1.1.
Function decompose_numeral is easy to use. Just pass an int number and a language* to see a fully documented decomposition of the numeral.

'Performance Analysis' is the output of the script 'Code for Performance Analysis'. For 260 languages, it summarizes what lexicon of context-free functions is produced by the Numeral Decomposer 1.1.

In the plot 'Lexicon sizes of Versions 1.0 and 1.1 plotted.png', the blue line shows the lexicon sizes of the Numeral Decomposer 1.1 in arising order from left to right. The green line shows the lexicon sizes of the Numeral Decomposer 1.0 in arising order from left to right. For the sake of better presentation, we did not plot over each single value but only over 20 mean values of 14 adjacent values each.

In the plot 'Ratios of Version 1.1 lexicon sizes to Version 1.0 lexicon sizes.png', we plotted by which ratios the Numeral Decomposer 1.1 reduced lexica in comparison to the Numeral Decomposer 1.0.

*Pass a language by writing one the strings listed in 'Languages'. In order to use the written out language terms, you also need to download 'Numeral.csv' and link its path to FILE_PATH_OF_LANGUAGESANDNUMBERS_DATA_CSV in the code.
